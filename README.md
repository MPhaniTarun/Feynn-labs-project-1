# Feynn-labs-project-1
As part of my Feynn Labs internship project-1, I have made a Grocery Recommendation System using Apriori Algorithm which can be employed by small eCommerce platforms to increase their sales and improve their customer experience.<br><br>
The aim of the final product is to help the small-scale eCommerce platforms to level up the
business and boost theirsales. This helps them to give an insight of what customers are buying 
and finds the most frequent item set subset that are bought.
<ul>
  <li>Frequent itemset subset in the purchase history.</li>
  <li>Analysis based on the association rules.</li>
  <li>The important metrics for the association rules are:</li>
<li>Support: This depicts how popular an itemset is in proportion to how many transactions the itemset is appeared.</li>
<li>Confidence: The probability that a transaction that contains the items on the LHS of the rule also contains the item on the RHS. Greater the confidence, greater the return rate expected for a given rule.</li>
<li>Lift: Lift specifies how likely an item is purchased when another item is purchased while controlling for how popular that item is.</li>
</ul><br>
Apriori Algorithm is used to find the Association rules between the products.
